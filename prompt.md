i am starting a new university project.
It is a game to help students learning how to calculate different order determinants: second order, third order and fourth order.
I don't have any server so i am gonna have to use free ones either netlify or vercel. If you can suggest better options, please let me know.

I am not planning to use any database. I guess browser local storage would be sufficient.
Based on deployment restrictions, i am gonna have to stick to one programming language and framework: React JS for javascript.
If you can suggest better options, please let me know.

I am gonna code this project using neovim. I create react project with vite.
I recently decided to learn tailwind css, i think this project would be good for me to learn using tailwind in jsx.

I have thought game process well so far but the main problem is i don't have its design for front-end and i don't have designer friend to do it for me.
Can you help if i tell everything thoroughly about the project mechanics?
